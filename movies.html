        <h2>What have I learned from the experience?</h2><br>
        <p>
            I've already learned many things. But I am aware that I still have much to learn. I'm determined to work and be recognized. Through my internship, I've learned how to cope with the realities of the world and communicate with many types of people, but because of the Lord's guidance, I always have a winning attitude and tell myself, "I'm going to win this." On my first day as an intern, I didn't think I could do a good job, but as time went on, I saw that my confidence and self-belief had grown. Furthermore, I realized how important time management is.
        </p><br>
        <h2>My experiences with the people around me on-site/online</h2><br>
        <p>
            In such a hectic setting, it is easy to become lost. Every department at NCO engages the IT Department for marketing and advertising needs, involving a variety of viewpoints and opinions. Even team members will not always share their opinions or agree with your designs/ideas. Once, twice, and occasionally ten times, you will need to make modifications. Don't take it to heart no matter how many adjustments are made because, in most cases, they will lead to an improved final result. 
        </p><br><h2>The most memorable event during my practicum</h2><br>
        <p>
            The most memorable experience from my practicum was attending the convention at the Acacia Hotel. I got to interact with and meet a variety of people. It was great since it gave me the impression that I was an actual employee, not simply an intern. 
        </p><br>
        <h2>What I can recommend for the improvement of the Practicum Program</h2><br>
        <p>
            New employees should be allowed to use their newly acquired skills after learning them from the instructor, all while being closely supervised by their trainer.
Trainers ought to assess their performance at this point. The trainer can address and resolve any problems if any exist.
Conduct an evaluation once the employee has finished their on-the-job training to make sure they have learned the skills required for the position.
        </p><br>
        <h2>My advice to those who will take their practicum soon</h2><br>
        <p>
            Internships offer the chance to network and establish lifelong career relationships. Make an extra effort to connect with and build connections with individuals from other departments. You never know who might have the one connection or resource to help you obtain your ideal career. They'll remember you most for your energy, work ethic, and optimism.
